# Spectral Knowledge Distillation for Intrusion Detection

## Project Description
This repository contains implementations of spectral-based knowledge distillation methods for network intrusion detection systems. The project explores efficient knowledge transfer from large teacher models to compact student models using spectral decomposition techniques.

## Key Components
- Spectral Relational Knowledge Distillation (SRRD)
- Weighted Spectral Projection methods
- Baseline distillation implementations (VanillaKD, CorrKD)
- Evaluation framework for noise robustness and convergence analysis

## Supported Datasets
- CICDDoS2019
- CICIoT2023

## Repository Structure
The codebase is organized into modular directories for models, training scripts, data loaders, and evaluation utilities.

## Research Context
This work investigates spectral methods for improving the robustness and efficiency of knowledge distillation in security applications.

## Getting Started
Refer to individual script documentation for specific usage instructions.
